3.0-beta.4:
* multiple file selection for en/de/cryption
* encryption and decryption now use threads
* add configure script (check gtk 3.12 and glib 2.40)
* change from progressbar to spinner when enc/dec ??????
* riallinare dialog hashes (tutto su stesso hbox? ritornare a grid?)
* capire xk errori su altre distro (xubuntu 14.04/10/15.04 Source ID 1540 was not found when attempting to remove it)
* to have a thread for a long running operation, and every time you want to update your UI from a thread, you schedule a UI update using g_idle_add() or g_main_context_invoke()
* look at GTask and GThreadPool instead of using an array of statically allocated threads
il flow sarebbe:
1) create the gtk_dialog with X gtk_entry and X gtk_check_button
2) when a gtk_check_button is clicked a thread will be created (this thread won't update the UI, it will just compute an hash and return the result)
3) inside the function which has created the gthread I have to add a g_idle_add to schedule the gui update.
